# fleischerfoundSite

This is a freelance project for local nonprofit The Fleischer Foundation, which sponsors education and provides mentorship for  for students in Nairobi, Kenya. It is a responsive static site to be hosted through AWS.

**Temporarily deployed at https://ncmine13.github.io/fleischerfoundSite/**

Uses:
* HTML/CSS/jQuery
* Twitter Bootstrap
* Amazon Web Services (Route 53, S3)
* Mailchimp Developer 
* PayPal Developer

Background:
The Fleischer Foundation initially had a templated site hosted on GoDaddy, and its founders contacted me in order to move the site to HTML in order to gain more control over the code. They also wanted to add an additional PayPal button for recurring donations. Using the original site for reference and content, I reconstructed the static site and streamlined the UX/UI. The site is hosted on AWS S3 and I will transfer the domain to AWS Route 53 as soon as the code is finalized.
